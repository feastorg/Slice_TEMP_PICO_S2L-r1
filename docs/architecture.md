Overview of the electrical, firmware, and mechanical design of this Slice.

## 🧠 Purpose

<!-- Briefly describe the function of the Slice -->

This Slice is designed to serve as a template slice for creating new SLICE modules, with variants supporting different mechanical and electrical configurations. Intended to standardize layout and encourage reuse.
